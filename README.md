# ProceduralCity
Procedural Generation of Cities

Building on Visual Studio:
Make sure you use the 2012 compiler
Using the Developer Command Prompt:
  - qmake -tp vc ProceduralCity.pro (This creates the new project file from Qt's project file)
  Reload the project in VS. I.e. make sure it uses this new project file
  Build as normal
